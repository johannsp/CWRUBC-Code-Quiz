When the user press the Start button a timed quiz will begin.  The time
remaining is displayed as the user answers the numbered questions.  The user
can either click a letter button below the displayed question or type the
letter for the correct answer.  The user cannot repeat a question and a five
second time penalty is assessed for each wrong answer.

Once the quiz ends either due to time running out or all questions being
completed the user will have the opportunity to records his initials on the
high score screen.
